# Snake-Game-queue-concept

This project is a classic Snake Game developed in C++ to demonstrate the concept of queues in programming. The game simulates the traditional snake game where the player controls a snake to eat food, making it grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls and itself.

**Features:**

**Queue Implementation:** Utilizes a queue data structure to manage the snake's body segments, showcasing how data can be efficiently handled in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) manner.

**Game Mechanics:**
* The player controls the snake's movement using arrow keys.
* The objective is to eat food items that appear randomly on the screen, increasing the snake's length.
* The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the wall.
* 
**User Interface:** Simple console-based UI that provides a clear view of the game state.
  
**How to Run**
* Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., Devc++, code block).
* Clone the repository:
* Navigate to the project directory
* Compile the code
* Run the game
  
**Objective of project:**
  
* Understanding of queue data structures and their applications.
* Experience in game development using C++.
* Enhanced problem-solving skills through game logic implementation.
